# Chapter 1 Outline: The Rough Draft

## Goal
Establish Elias's secret life as a "Narrative Guardian" and introduce Maya Lin, his new pragmatic editor. Show the contrast between Elias's chaotic magic and Maya's structured reality.

## Emotional Arc
Exhaustion (20%) → Frustration (40%) → Intrigue (50%)

## Scenes

### Scene 1: The Frontline (Kerry Park)
-   **Setting**: Kerry Park, overlooking the Seattle skyline. Rainy, grey afternoon.
-   **Action**: Elias is frantically typing on his laptop. To a passerby, he looks like a stressed writer. In reality, he is fighting a "Narrative Distortion" taking the form of a giant, distorted pigeon/griffin construct made of ink and bad tropes.
-   **Magic**: Elias uses "Scripting". He types a description of the creature dissolving.
-   **Climax**: He hits "Enter". The creature explodes into a harmless shower of ordinary pigeon feathers.
-   **Outcome**: Elias is drained. He receives a notification: New editor assigned. Meeting in 30 minutes.

### Scene 2: The Sanctum (Elias's Apartment)
-   **Setting**: Elias's apartment. Walls lined with books, papers everywhere. Claustrophobic, smells of stale coffee and old paper.
-   **Character**: Maya Lin arrives. Sharp, professional, wearing a pristine trench coat. Contrast with Elias's messy cardigan.
-   **Interaction**: Maya enters the "fortress". She is unimpressed by the mess. She treats Elias like a rebellious teenager/flaky author.
-   **Dialogue**: Sharp banter. Maya: "Your pacing is a disaster." Elias: "It's stylistic chaos."

### Scene 3: The Edit (Living Room)
-   **Conflict**: A minor "Shadow Beast" distortion is lurking in the corner of the ceiling. Elias is trying to ignore it/contain it passively while dealing with Maya.
-   **Action**: Maya picks up a manuscript (which is actually the containment spell for the Shadow Beast). She reads it.
-   **The Twist**: Maya critiques the "magic system" in the story. "This shadow monster makes no sense. Why isn't it vulnerable to UV light? It's a shadow."
-   **The Magic**: She uses her red pen to cross out a line and write "Weakness: Light".
-   **Result**: The floor lamp next to them suddenly flares with blinding intensity (the "edit" taking effect). The Shadow Beast screeches and vanishes.
-   **Ending**: The bulb shatters. Darkness returns. Maya: "See? Bad wiring. Just like your plot." Elias stares at her, realizing she just accidentally cast a spell.

## Key Themes
-   Order vs. Chaos
-   The weight of the unacknowledged hero.
-   Magic in the mundane.
