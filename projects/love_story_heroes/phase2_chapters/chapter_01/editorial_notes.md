# Editorial Notes: Chapter 1

## General Feedback
Strong opening. The concept of "editing reality" is introduced effectively through action. The contrast between Elias's chaotic internal narration and Maya's external precision works well.

## Specific Critique

### 1. Pacing & Transition
-   **Current**: The jump from the park to the apartment is a bit abrupt.
-   **Suggestion**: Add a transitional sentence or two about the journey home. Does the rain feel different after he "deletes" the monster?

### 2. Character Voice
-   **Elias**: His internal monologue is good ("deleted," "wrong genre"). Keep this meta-commentary.
-   **Maya**: Her dialogue is sharp. Ensure she doesn't react *too* casually to the exploding lamp. It should startle her physically, even if she rationalizes it intellectually immediately after.

### 3. Magic System ("Scripting")
-   **Clarification**: The mechanics of Elias typing are clear.
-   **Enhancement**: When Maya "edits" the shadow beast, make the connection to the lamp more visceral. The ink from her pen should almost *seem* to conduct the electricity/light before the bulb blows.

### 4. Sensory Details
-   **Smell**: The ozone/burning smell after the lamp explodes is a nice touch.
-   **Sound**: emphasize the *silence* of the shadow beast vs. the *noise* of the typewriter/keyboard.

## Decision
Proceed to final draft with minor polish on the climax scene.
