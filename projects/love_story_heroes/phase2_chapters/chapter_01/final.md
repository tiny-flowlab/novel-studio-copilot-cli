# Chapter 1: The Rough Draft

Rain didn't just fall in Seattle; it edited the world. It blurred sharp edges, turned concrete into mirrors, and washed away the mistakes of the day.

For Elias Thorne, the rain was currently trying to wash away a mistake the size of a minivan.

He sat on a damp bench in Kerry Park, a battered laptop balanced on his knees. To anyone walking by—dog walkers huddled under umbrellas, tourists taking grim selfies with the grey Space Needle—he was just another writer facing a deadline. His dark hair was a mess, his cardigan was three sizes too big, and his fingers were flying across the keyboard with a desperation that bordered on manic.

In reality, he was trying to delete a griffin.

The creature was perched on the railing ten feet away. It wasn't a biological animal; it was a Narrative Distortion, a glitch in the fabric of reality made of ink and bad writing. Its feathers were jagged strokes of calligraphy, its eyes burning like cigarette burns on film. It screeched—a sound like tearing paper—and lunged.

Elias didn't look up. He typed.

*The beast's wings were heavy, burdened by gravity and poor aerodynamics. It stumbled, the narrative logic of its existence failing.*

As he hit the period key, the griffin faltered in mid-air. Its left wing flickered, turning momentarily into a smudge of graphite before solidifying again.

"Come on," Elias muttered, his breath hitching. "Work with me here. You don't belong in this genre."

The griffin recovered, its beak snapping inches from Elias's face. He could smell it—ozone and old library books.

Elias's fingers blurred. *It was not a mythical creature. It was a mundane nuisance, a trick of the light and shadow.*

He slammed the 'Enter' key.

The world seemed to shudder. The massive, terrifying beast exploded—not into blood or magic, but into a harmless flurry of grey pigeon feathers. They drifted down around him, sticking to his wet hair.

Elias slumped back against the bench, exhaling a breath he felt he’d been holding since Tuesday. "Deleted," he whispered.

His screen flashed. A notification popped up in the corner, bright and demanding against the grey backdrop of his word processor.

**INCOMING MESSAGE: CHIMERA PUBLISHING**
*From: M. Lin*
*Subject: Introductory Meeting*
*Time: 14:00 (Today)*

Elias checked his watch. 1:45 PM.

"Oh, for the love of..." He scrambled to pack his laptop, shoving it into a messenger bag that was more patch than canvas. "Why does the real world have worse pacing than the monsters?"

The walk home was a blur of wet pavement and anxiety. As he hurried through the drizzle, the city felt lighter, as if the deletion of the griffin had freed up some processing power in the universe. But the knot in his stomach remained. Editors were worse than monsters. Monsters you could delete. Editors deleted *you*.

***

Elias's apartment was less a living space and more a fortress of solitude built from paper. Books were stacked in precarious towers that defied physics. Drafts of containment spells—disguised as terrible sci-fi manuscripts—carpeted the floor. The air smelled permanently of stale coffee and anxiety.

He burst through the door at 1:58 PM, shedding his wet coat and kicking a pile of rejection letters under the sofa.

"Okay. Okay. Normal human author. I can do this."

He ran a hand through his damp hair, only succeeding in making it look more like a bird's nest. He had just sat down at his desk—a grand mahogany piece buried under sticky notes—when the knock came.

It wasn't a polite knock. It was a punctuation mark. Three sharp, precise raps.

Elias opened the door.

Maya Lin stood there like a sans-serif font in a world of messy handwriting. She wore a sharp trench coat, belted with military precision. Her bob cut was razor-straight, and her glasses reflected the hallway light so perfectly he couldn't see her eyes for a moment. She held a red fountain pen in one hand and a tablet in the other.

"Elias Thorne?" she asked. Her voice was cool, clear, and utterly devoid of patience.

"That's me," Elias said, leaning against the doorframe and trying to look like he hadn't just deleted a mythological beast twenty minutes ago. "You must be..."

"Maya Lin. Senior Editor. Chimera Publishing." She looked past him, into the chaos of his apartment. Her eyebrow twitched. Just once. "May I come in? Or are we conducting this meeting in the hallway to avoid the fire hazard?"

Elias stepped back. "Right. Sorry. Come in. Excuse the... process."

Maya stepped inside, her heels clicking on the hardwood floor. She navigated the maze of book towers with the grace of a cat. She stopped in the center of the living room, looking around.

"This isn't a process, Mr. Thorne," she said, running a finger along a dusty bookshelf. "It's a cry for help."

"It's creative clutter," Elias defended, moving a stack of papers so she could sit on the armchair. "It helps me think."

"It helps entropy," Maya corrected. She sat down, crossing her legs and placing her tablet on her knee. She looked at him. "Let's be blunt. Your last three manuscripts were... difficult."

"They were experimental," Elias said, sitting on the edge of his desk.

"They were structurally unsound," Maya said. "The pacing was erratic. The internal logic was inconsistent. And the endings... they just trailed off. Like you were running away from your own story."

Elias winced. She wasn't wrong. Those 'stories' had been containment protocols for Class-3 anomalies. He *had* run away. He'd barely survived.

"I'm a pantser," Elias said weakly. "I write by the seat of my pants."

"And I'm a plotter," Maya said, uncapping her red pen. "And I'm here to tell you that your pants are on fire."

Elias blinked. "Is that a metaphor?"

"With your sales numbers? Barely."

Suddenly, the air in the room grew heavy. The temperature dropped ten degrees in a second.

Elias stiffened. He knew that feeling.

In the corner of the ceiling, shadows were pooling. Not normal shadows—these were thick, oily, and moving against the light source. A Shadow Beast. A small one, a scavenger attracted to the residue of the griffin fight.

Maya didn't seem to notice the supernatural chill. She was too busy reviewing a manuscript she'd pulled from her bag.

"Take this scene in Chapter 4," she said, tapping the paper with her pen. "The protagonist is trapped in a room of absolute darkness by a shadow monster. And he just... waits?"

The Shadow Beast in the corner began to uncoil, a silent, gaping maw opening in the darkness.

Elias's heart hammered. He needed to write it away. He reached for a notepad on his desk.

"He's analyzing the situation," Elias said, his voice tight. "He's... observing."

"He's being passive," Maya argued. She scribbled something on the page. "It's boring. And it makes no sense. It's a shadow, Elias. Shadows are defined by light."

The beast dropped from the ceiling, silent as smoke, aiming for Maya's exposed neck.

"Maya, move—" Elias started, reaching for his pen.

Maya ignored him. She slashed her red pen across a paragraph. "If there's a shadow," she said, "there has to be a light source. The monster isn't invincible. It's just geometry."

She wrote two words in the margin: *Weakness: Light.*

The ink from her pen seemed to shimmer for a split second, a vein of red lightning on the page.

*CRACK.*

The floor lamp beside the armchair—a dusty, flickering thing—didn't just turn on. It exploded with the brilliance of a supernova.

White light flooded the room, harsh and absolute.

The Shadow Beast shrieked—a sound like high-pitched static—and disintegrated instantly. The shadows didn't just retreat; they were obliterated, burned away by the sudden, impossible intensity of the bulb.

Then, with a *pop*, the bulb shattered, raining glass onto the carpet. The room plunged back into normal, gloomy daylight.

Maya flinched, ducking her head instinctively as the bulb blew. She stared at the smoking lamp for a heartbeat, her composure momentarily cracked.

Elias stood frozen, his hand halfway to his notepad.

Maya brushed a shard of glass off her sleeve, regaining her cool with visible effort. She looked annoyed, but unsurprised.

"See?" she said, gesturing to the broken lamp with her pen. "Bad wiring. Just like your plot structure. Too much resistance, not enough flow. Eventually, something breaks."

Elias stared at the scorch mark on the carpet where the monster had been. Then he looked at Maya. She was calmly making another note on the manuscript.

She hadn't just edited a sentence. She had edited reality.

"Who are you?" Elias whispered.

Maya looked up, adjusting her glasses. "I told you. I'm your editor. And we have a lot of work to do."
