# Editorial Notes: Chapter 2

## Overall Assessment
**Rating**: 88/100
**Status**: Approved for Phase 3

## Strengths
1.  **Concept Integration**: The idea of "editing reality" is executed brilliantly in the coffee shop scene. The "Revision Loop" is a creative interpretation of a glitch.
2.  **Character Dynamic**: Elias and Maya have excellent chemistry. The contrast between his chaotic creativity and her rigid structure is driving the plot effectively.
3.  **Pacing**: The transition from the domestic "lamp" incident to the public "coffee shop" incident scales the threat well.

## Weaknesses & Suggestions
1.  **Maya's Acceptance**: Maya accepts the "magic" relatively quickly at the end. In Chapter 3, ensure we see her internal struggle with this new reality. She shouldn't just be "okay" with it; she should be trying to rationalize it through her editor's lens (which she starts doing, but needs to maintain).
2.  **The System Message**: The introduction of "The Narrative" sending texts is a bold move. Ensure this doesn't turn into a generic "GameLit" system. Keep it mysterious and tied to the literary theme.

## Specific Notes
*   **Scene 1**: The "dog" edit is a great subtle test. It establishes the rules without a big light show.
*   **Scene 2**: The description of the cafe ("jazz underwater") is evocative. The "scone/tire iron" imagery is surreal and funny.
*   **Climax**: The line "I edited a sentence!" is strong. It grounds the magic in her skill set.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Chapter 3. The "Plot Hole" needs to be a physical threat that requires their combined skills to close.
