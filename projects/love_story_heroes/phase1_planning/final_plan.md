# Final Plan: The Narrative Guardian

## Project Summary
-   **Title**: The Narrative Guardian
-   **Genre**: Urban Fantasy Romance
-   **Target Audience**: Adult/New Adult
-   **Format**: 3-Chapter Short Story

## Documents
-   **Concept**: A writer protecting Earth via stories x An editor who grounds him.
-   **Structure**: 3 Acts (Rough Draft -> Edit -> Final Proof).
-   **Characters**: Elias (Chaos/Magic) & Maya (Order/Logic).
-   **Setting**: Seattle + "The Narrative Layer".

## Execution Strategy (Phase 2)
1.  **Chapter 1**: Focus on the contrast between Elias's chaotic magic view and Maya's mundane frustration. Humor is key here.
2.  **Chapter 2**: Build the romance through the work. The "Editing" montage should feel like a battle scene and a date at the same time.
3.  **Chapter 3**: High stakes. The magic system relies on their partnership. The climax must show them writing *together*.

## Pacing & Tone
-   **Start**: Fast, disorienting (Elias's POV).
-   **Middle**: Slower, intimate, building tension.
-   **End**: Explosive, then warm.

## Approval Status
-   **Concept**: Ready
-   **Plot**: Ready
-   **Characters**: Ready
-   **Setting**: Ready

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Writing.**
