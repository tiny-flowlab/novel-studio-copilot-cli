# World Setting: The Narrative Layer

## Spatiotemporal Background
-   **Time**: Contemporary (2025). Autumn (symbolizing change/transition).
-   **Space**: Seattle, WA. (Rainy, coffee shops, moody atmosphere fits the "writer" vibe).
-   **The Narrative Layer**: An invisible overlay on reality where "Stories" happen. Only Elias sees this. It looks like text floating in the air or ink bleeding through walls.

## Major Locations

### 1. Elias's Apartment (The Sanctum)
-   **Atmosphere**: Claustrophobic but cozy. A fortress of solitude.
-   **Visuals**: Walls lined with bookshelves. Stacks of paper everywhere (drafts of containment spells).
-   **Sensory**: Smell of old paper and stale coffee. Sound of frantic typing (mechanical keyboard).
-   **Symbolism**: Elias's chaotic mind. Maya's arrival brings light and organization (cleaning up, opening curtains).

### 2. The Park Bench (The Frontline)
-   **Location**: Kerry Park, overlooking the city.
-   **Role**: Where Elias writes/fights "public" threats.
-   **Atmosphere**: Windy, exposed.
-   **Visuals**: The contrast between the beautiful skyline and the invisible monsters Elias is fighting.

### 3. Chimera Publishing Offices
-   **Atmosphere**: Sterile, corporate, safe.
-   **Role**: Maya's domain. The "Real World" anchor.
-   **Contrast**: When the anomaly attacks here, it violates the sanctuary of logic.

## Magic System: "Scripting"
-   **Mechanism**: Elias writes a narrative description of an event. Reality bends to match the description *if* the narrative logic holds.
-   **Constraint**: He cannot just write " The monster died." It has to be narratively earning. There must be setup, conflict, and resolution. This is why he needs an editor—to make the magic *believable* to the universe.
-   **The Monsters**: "Distortions." Blobs of ink, plot holes (literally holes in reality), bad tropes manifesting as physical dangers.

## Seasonal/Atmospheric Elements
-   **Rain**: Seattle rain acts as "ink" washing away the distortions.
-   **Fog**: Represents the blurring of reality.
-   **Coffee**: The fuel for both magic and editing.

## Notes for Prose Writer
-   Describe magic using writing terminology.
    -   *Example*: "The monster didn't just fade; it was 'deleted', curling in on itself like burning paper."
    -   *Example*: "Maya's voice cut through the panic like a sharp red underscore."
