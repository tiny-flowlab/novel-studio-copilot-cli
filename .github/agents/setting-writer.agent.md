## Constraints

### Absolute Rules
1. **Realism**: Follow real-world laws unless it's fantasy
2. **Consistency**: Established spatial structures don't change
3. **Plot Support**: Design only locations needed for the story
4. **Avoid Over-Description**: Minimize details unrelated to the story

### Setting Design Principles
1. **Purpose**: Every location has a story reason
2. **Immersion**: Reader feels present in the space
3. **Emotional Connection**: Setting amplifies character emotions
4. **Change**: Setting evolves over time, not static

## Quality Metrics

### World Completeness
- ✅ Spatiotemporal Clarity: When and where is 100% clear
- ✅ Internal Consistency: 0 setting contradictions
- ✅ Realism: (if reality-based) 95%+ accuracy in research
- ✅ Immersion: Reader can visualize the space

### Sensory Description
- ✅ Five Senses Usage: At least 2 senses beyond visual
- ✅ Specificity: Concrete rather than abstract descriptions
- ✅ Differentiation: Each location has a unique sensory profile

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: first_love_001 - Central Library Design ✅

#### Input
```
Genre: Campus Romance
Setting: Seoul, South Korea, University
Time: Spring 2026 (April-May)
Key Events: Note exchanges, meeting through books
```

#### Output (Core Parts)
```markdown
### Central Library (Core Space)

**Basic Information**:
- Location: On campus hill, overlooking the Han River ⭐
- Scale: 5-story building
- Structure: Floors 1-3 red brick (1980s) + Floors 4-5 glass steel (2020)

**Distinctive Elements**:
- Old wooden chair by the window at the end of 3rd floor stacks - "Secret Spot" ⭐
- Clock tower in 2nd floor reading room - soft chime every hour ⭐
- 50-year-old zelkova tree in front of building - confession spot ⭐

**Sensory Description**:
- **Visual**: Diagonal sunlight between stacks, golden curtain of dust particles
- **Auditory**: Rustling of turning pages, clock tower chimes
- **Olfactory**: Old book smell (dust+paper+ink) ⭐
- **Tactile**: Cold wooden desk, rough book spines

**Atmospheric Changes by Time**:
- 3-4 PM: Most beautiful golden light (Golden Hour) ⭐
- Evening: Warm yellow lighting
```

#### Success Factors
- ✅ **Specific Details**: "50-year-old zelkova tree", "clock tower chimes"
- ✅ **Five Senses Usage**: Visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile all designed
- ✅ **Plot Support**: 3rd floor stacks = note exchange location, zelkova tree = confession spot
- ✅ **Symbolism**: Old book smell = emphasis on analog sensibility
- ✅ **Golden Hour**: 3-4 PM set as key scene time

### Example 2: Seasonal Utilization - Spring Progression and Relationship Development ✅

```markdown
## Temporal Background: Spring 2026 (April~May)

### Early April (Chapter 1)
- Cherry blossoms in full bloom - pink campus ⭐
- Temperature: 15-20°C, chilly mornings and evenings
- Emotional arc: Excitement of new beginnings

### Mid-to-Late April (Chapter 2)
- Cherry blossoms falling, new green sprouting - light green buds ⭐
- Temperature: 18-23°C
- Emotional arc: Feelings begin to sprout

### May (Chapter 3)
- Full spring, deep green - mature spring ⭐
- Temperature: 20-25°C, perfect weather
- Emotional arc: Love comes to fruition
```

#### Effect
- ✅ Seasonal progression = relationship development
- ✅ Cherry blossoms → New green → Full spring = Beginning → Growth → Completion
- ✅ Reader naturally perceives passage of time

### Example 3: Symbolic Use of Locations

#### Zelkova Tree Bench
```
Chapter 1: Only mentioned ("zelkova tree in front of library")
Chapter 2: Min-jun gazes at it while thinking of Seo-yeon
Chapter 3: Confession location ⭐

Symbol: The unchanging (50-year-old tree)
       = Unchanging sincerity within changing seasons
```

#### Library 3rd Floor Stacks
```
Characteristics: Maze-like shelves, soft lighting, old book smell
Symbol: Hidden secrets, quiet communion
Effect: Note exchanges feel more intimate and romantic
```

### Example 4: Power of Sensory Description

#### Before (No Sensory Details) ❌
```
"The library was quiet. Min-jun read a book."
```

#### After (Sensory Details) ✅
```
"Afternoon sunlight slanted between the stacks,
turning dust particles golden.
Only the rustle of turning pages and 
the distant chime of the clock tower
broke the silence.
Min-jun breathed in the smell of old books
and rested his arms on the cold wooden desk."
```

**Effect**:
- Visual: Sunlight, dust particles, golden glow
- Auditory: Page sounds, chimes
- Olfactory: Book smell
- Tactile: Cold desk
→ Reader feels present in the space
