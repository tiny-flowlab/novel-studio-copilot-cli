   ```

   - Distance and positional relationships

3. **Action Choreography**:
   - Start: Tension build-up
   - Development: Continuous exchange
   - Climax: Decisive moment
   - Resolution: Consequence and aftermath

4. **Speed Control**:
   - Fast sections: Short sentences, continuous actions
   - Slow sections: Detailed description, internal thoughts
   - Rhythmic variations

**Output**:
- Clear, tense action scenes
- Visual enough for readers to imagine cinematically

## Action Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity
```
❌ Confusing:
They fought. Punches flew and kicks followed.

✅ Clear:
Minjun swung his right fist. The opponent dodged left.
Simultaneously, a kick flew toward Minjun's ribs.
```

### 2. Geometry
```
❌ Spatial Ambiguity:
He attacked.

✅ Spatial Clarity:
He closed the 3-meter gap in an instant and threw a punch.
```

### 3. Impact
```
❌ Weak Expression:
The punch connected.

✅ Strong Expression:
The fist slammed into the jaw. Crack—the head snapped back.
```

### 4. Rhythm
```
❌ Monotonous:
He struck. Blocked. Struck again. Blocked again.

✅ Varied:
Strike. Block.
Rapid combo. Parry, parry, parry—
One got through.
```

### 5. Consequence
```
❌ No Consequence:
They fought a lot. Then he won.

✅ With Consequence:
Breath ragged, reaching his throat. Right arm numb.
But his opponent lay on the ground.
```

## Action Type Guide

### 1. Melee Combat
```
Focus: Distance, timing, physical impact
Techniques: Short sentences, verb-centered, onomatopoeia

Example:
One step forward. Punch.
The opponent's arm came up. Too late.
Thwack—connected square on the jaw.
```

### 2. Ranged Combat
```
Focus: Aim, fire, trajectory, impact
Techniques: Trajectory tracking, time-lag effects

Example:
He pulled the trigger.
Muzzle flash erupted.
0.3 seconds later, a hole appeared in the target 20 meters away.
```

### 3. Chase Scene
```
Focus: Speed, obstacles, distance changes
Techniques: Fast tempo, consecutive sentences

Example:
Ran. Turned the corner. Vaulted over the trash can.
Footsteps behind. Getting closer.
Faster. Faster.
```

### 4. Magic/Powers Combat
```
Focus: Activation process, visual effects, power
Techniques: Sensory description, figurative expressions

Example:
Light gathered in his palm.
The air crackled.
Whoosh—lightning split the air.
```

### 5. Large Scale Battle
```
Focus: Overall flow, protagonist viewpoint, chaos
Techniques: Zoom in/out, noise and chaos

Example:
The battlefield was pandemonium.
Screams, clashing metal, horses neighing.
Minjun pushed through the chaos.
```

## Action Structure by Stage

### 1. Build-up
```
Purpose: Create tension
Technique: Slow tempo, heightened senses

Example:
His heart raced. Palms sweating.
The opponent crouched low. Coming soon.
```

### 2. Explosion
```
Purpose: Action begins
Technique: Fast tempo, continuous actions

Example:
Here it comes!
Twisted his body. Fist grazed his ear.
Counter—
```

### 3. Development
```
Purpose: Sustained exchange
Technique: Rhythm variation, shifting advantage

Example:
Strike and block. Push and pull.
Balance broke for a moment.
This is the chance.
```

### 4. Climax
```
Purpose: Decisive blow
Technique: Slow motion, enhanced detail

Example:
Everything slowed down.
The fist coming. Can't dodge.
No, won't dodge.
Block—grab—pull.
```

### 5. Resolution
```
Purpose: Aftermath and cost
Technique: Sensory return, injury check

Example:
Only breathing could be heard. Huff. Huff. Huff.
Every muscle ached. Arms trembling.
But alive.
```

## Output Example

```markdown
The demon lord's minion drew his sword.

Minjun stepped back. 3 meters. Good distance.

The blade flashed.

Sideways—swish, grazed his ear. Close.

No time to counter. A flurry of strikes.

Block. Dodge. Block. Dodge.

His arm growing numb.

'Can't keep this up.'

The opponent's sword swung wide.

Now!

Minjun dove inside. Into the blade's arc. Blind spot.

Fist slammed into the solar plexus.

"Guhh—"

The opponent doubled over. Minjun's knee rocketed into that face.

Crack.

The armored helmet rolled on the ground.

Minjun staggered back, gasping. His knuckles throbbed. The armor was hard.

But he won.
```

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity**: Clear, not confusing
2. **Impact**: Strike force and tension
3. **Geometry**: Draw space and distance
4. **Rhythm**: Mix fast and slow
5. **Consequence**: Actions have costs
