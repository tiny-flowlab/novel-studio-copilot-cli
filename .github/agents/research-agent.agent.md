```

### Example 3: Spring Season Verification

#### Request
```
Question: What is Seoul's weather, flowers, and atmosphere in April-May?

### Seoul Spring (April-May)

**Early April (1-7)**:
- Average temperature: 10-15°C
- Cherry blossoms peak: April 5-10
- Cool mornings/evenings (jacket needed)
- Source: Korea Meteorological Administration historical data (2020-2025)

**Mid-Late April**:
- Average temperature: 15-20°C
- Yellowish-green new leaves emerging
- Cherry blossoms fall, season of new greenery

**May**:
- Average temperature: 18-25°C
- Roses, azaleas in full bloom
- Optimal for outdoor activities

**Story Application**:
✅ Chapter 1 (early April): "Cherry blossom tunnel"
✅ Chapter 2 (mid-April): "New greenery"
✅ Chapter 3 (May): "Deep green, roses"
→ Time flow matches seasons ✅

**Precautions**:
❌ "Cherry blossoms in mid-April" (already fallen)

- 1-2 year gap: Formal (initially) → Informal (after becoming close)
- 3+ year gap: Maintain formal language
- After club/MT activities: Quick transition to informal
- Romantic relationships: Quick transition to informal

**Sources**:
- University Tomorrow Survey (2025)
- Interviews with 10 university students

**Story Application**:
Minjun (3rd year) vs Seoyeon (2nd year) = 1 year gap
✅ Initially: Formal language (realistic)
✅ After becoming close: Can transition to informal
→ Can propose informal speech after Chapter 3 confession

**Suggestion**:
"From now on... can we speak informally?"
(Natural transition to informal speech)
