## Emotional Expression Principles

### 1. Show Don't Tell
```
❌ Tell:
Minjun was sad.

✅ Show:
His throat tightened. Words wouldn't come.
```

### 2. Physical Reactions
```
❌ Abstract:
She was very angry.

✅ Specific:
Her nails dug into her palm. She clenched her teeth. Her jaw trembled.
```

### 3. Sensory Distortion
```
❌ Plain:
He was surprised.

✅ Sensory:
His ears rang. Surrounding sounds faded away like being underwater.
```

### 4. Internal Monologue
```
❌ Explanatory:
He thought he had made a mistake.

✅ Stream of thought:
'It's my fault. I... if only I hadn't done that.'
```

### 5. Fresh Metaphors
```
❌ Cliché:
His heart pounded.

✅ Fresh:
It felt like someone was beating a drum in his chest.
Faster and faster. Louder and louder.
```

In the center of her chest, something felt missing.
An unfillable void.
```

### 3. Anger
```

Sensory: Vision narrowing, sounds sharpening
Thoughts: Simplification, black-and-white logic

'Something's wrong.'
```

### Level 10: Explosive Emotions

A ringing sound filled her ears.

```markdown
"I'm sorry."

That was all.

Minjun couldn't lift his head.
His neck felt stiffly frozen.

'Sorry?'

His chest tightened. No, constricted.
An invisible hand seemed to be squeezing his heart.

"...Is that all?"

His voice trembled. Damn it. It shouldn't tremble.

"Minjun."

"Stop."

He approached. Minjun stepped back.

"Don't come closer."

No. I can't cry. Never.

But tears had a mind of their own.
Something warm rolled down his cheek.

'Damn.'

Minjun turned his face away.
