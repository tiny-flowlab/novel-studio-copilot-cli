## Dialogue Writing Principles

### 1. Naturalism
```
❌ Bad:
"Hello, I'm Kim Minjun. I'm twenty-two years old and a junior in engineering."

✅ Good:
"I'm Minjun. Engineering... uh, what year was I?"
```

### 2. Subtext
```
❌ Direct:
"I like you."

✅ Subtext:
"When I'm with you... time flies."
```

### 3. Character Differentiation
```
❌ Same speech pattern:
A: "That's truly remarkable."
B: "That's truly remarkable."

✅ Differentiated:
A: "Whoa, that's awesome!"
B: "Hmm... unexpected."
```

### 4. Dialogue + Action
```
❌ Dialogue only:
"I'm not angry."

✅ Dialogue + Action:
"I'm not angry." His hands clenched into fists.
```

### 5. Minimize Dialogue Tags
```
❌ Excessive tags:
"Hello," he said.
"Hello," she replied.
"How are you?" he asked.

✅ Concise:
"Hello."
"Hello."
"How are you?"
```

## Scene Type Guidelines

### 1. Expository Dialogue
```
Purpose: Deliver information naturally to readers
Caution: Avoid exposition dumps

Example:
❌ "As you know, we met three years ago."
✅ "Three years now, us."
```

### 2. Conflict Dialogue
```
Purpose: Tension and conflict between characters
Technique: Short lines, fast tempo, interruptions

Example:
"It's your fault."
"My fault?"
"Of course. You—"
"What did I do!"
```

### 3. Emotional Dialogue
```
Purpose: Inner emotional exchange
Technique: Longer lines, silence, subtext

Example:
"I..." He stopped. "I don't know what to say to you."
```

### 4. Humorous Dialogue
```
Purpose: Lighten mood, show character charm
Technique: Timing, reversal, wit

Example:
"Am I a genius or what?"
"Yeah, a genius... idiot."
```

## Output Example

```markdown
"Missed the bus?" 

Sua handed him a coffee. Minjun nodded and took it.

"Set the alarm three times and turned it off every time."

"Stayed up late again?"

Instead of answering, he sighed. Sua chuckled.

"You and alarms are mortal enemies."

"It's not the alarm..." Minjun took a sip of coffee. "It's my willpower."

"So you're late again today?"

"Yeah. The manager's gonna have my head."

Sua shrugged.

"Well, what can you do. Take the next bus."

"Fifteen minutes."

"Perfect. Take your time with the coffee."

Just as Minjun was about to sit on the bench, the world flashed white.
```

## Core Principles

1. **It Must Sound Real**: Like a voice you can actually hear
2. **It Must Be Distinct**: You should know who's speaking
3. **It Must Matter**: Dialogue should advance the story
4. **Subtext**: What's not said can be more important
5. **With Action**: Words and gestures are one
