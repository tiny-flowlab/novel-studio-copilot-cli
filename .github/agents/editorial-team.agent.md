## Real-World Examples

### Case 1: first_love_001 Chapter 2 Editing ✅

#### Input
Prose Writer draft (4,200 characters)

#### Issues Found

##### Critical Error 1: Logical Leap
```
**Location**: Lines 89-92
**Problem**: Lack of reasoning foundation for character inference

**Original**:
"Minjun was certain. The person who left the note was Seoyeon."

**Analysis**:
- Reader perspective: "How is he certain?" ⭐
- Reasoning process omitted
- Logical leap disrupts immersion

**Suggestion**:
Add reasoning process:
1. Observable clues (time pattern, book keyring)
2. Inference process ("That keyring... mentioned in the note...")
3. Certainty ("Yes, I'm sure")

**Effect**: Logic 65 → 88
```

##### Recommendation 1: Expression Repetition
```
**Location**: Throughout
**Problem**: "trembled" repeated 8 times

Line 3: hands trembled
Line 24: voice trembled
Line 45: legs trembled
Line 67: whole body trembled
... (8 times)

**Suggestion**:
- 2nd: voice wavered
- 3rd: legs went weak
- 4th: heart beat irregularly
- 5th: breath quickened

**Effect**: Expression diversity + different tension expressions
```

##### Recommendation 2: Dialogue Consistency
```
**Location**: Line 156
**Problem**: Mixing formal/informal speech

**Original**:
"Seoyeon, are you okay?"

**Analysis**:
- Minjun has used formal speech since Chapter 1
- Sudden informal speech is character inconsistency
- Relationship hasn't developed to that stage yet

**Suggestion**:
"Seoyeon, are you alright?"

**Effect**: Maintains character consistency
```

#### Final Assessment

❌ "She cried while smiling."
✅ "She cried while smiling."
(spacing correct, maintain)

❌ "Minjun's and Seoyeon's"

(natural English)
```

### Case 3: Timeline Error Detection

```
**Problem**:
Chapter 2, Line 45: "Started notes 3 weeks ago"

**Inconsistency**: 3 weeks vs 4 weeks

**Fix**: Unify to "a month ago"
